# metabroom

The goal of metabroom is to `broom` meta-analysis models produced by `metafor`. That is, when I finish it.  

See the **testing** file to see where I'm at. 

## Example

### Get example dataset

```{r Get a test model}
# Hmmm. What's best practice for loading %>% in packages? What's best practice for package dependencies?
library(metabroom)



# Check all is as it should be.
example_ma %>% 
  metafor::forest()

```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


### `augment`

```{r augment}
example_ma %>% augment()
```

### `tidy`

```{r tidy}
example_ma %>% tidy()
```

### `glance`

```{r glance}
example_ma %>% glance()
```
