Description: These methods were originally part of the [tidymeta::] 
  by Malcolm. Charles wanted to learn about dev and had some tweaks 
  to make to the glance function. She's bundled Malcolm's functions 
  so they can take a look and see what needs doing to get this 
  ported into the [broom::] package proper.
